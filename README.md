# Files in this repo

The script included will automatically download and unzip the file to the current working directory.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps of the assignment.

The output of the 5th step is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
